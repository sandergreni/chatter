# Project for learning Rust and the epoll way of handling sockets

epoll_server is a server that is used for chatting. The protocol is JOW (JSON Over the Wire or JSON on top of TCP).
I have always been a fan of learning by doing. In this case "doing" is to make a server that handles multiple connections/clients,
parsing JSON and CLI arguments, all written in Rust, all.
