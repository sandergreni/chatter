# Project for learning Rust and the epoll way of handling sockets

This is a workspace containing client, server and library code making chatting over a network possible. I am basically reinventing the wheel here :)
The server part of chatter is a server that handles multiple connections/clients using epoll. The protocol is JOW (JSON Over the Wire, I just made that acronym up or at least I think I did).
I have always been a fan of learning by doing and that is all this project is. I am learning Rust and epoll.
